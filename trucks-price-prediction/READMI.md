# Predicting the Sale Price of Trucks using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the sale price of trucks using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used in this project contains various features of trucks such as their mileage, make, model, and year of manufacturing. The target variable in this dataset is the sale price of the trucks.

The project is divided into the following sections:

1. Data collection: The dataset used in this project was collected from a popular online marketplace for trucks.
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing: The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to remove any missing values and outliers, and to transform categorical variables into numerical variables.
3. Exploratory data analysis: The dataset was explored to gain insights into the relationships between the features and the target variable.
4. Feature engineering: New features were created from the existing features to improve the performance of the machine learning models.
5. Model selection and training: Several machine learning models were evaluated and trained on the dataset to predict the sale price of trucks.
6. Model evaluation: The performance of the machine learning models was evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared.
